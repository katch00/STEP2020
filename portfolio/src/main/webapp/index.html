      <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
	<p>This is my portfolio.</p>
	<p> My name is Natalia Stroupe. </p>
	<p> I am going into my third year of schooling at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I am studying Computer Science with a specialization in cyber-security. My school offers a special program where I can add an extra year onto my studies and can graduate with a bachelors and masters at the same time! Because I can graduate a year early, I will be able to graduate in 2022 with both degrees! <p>
	<p> I really like cats :D </p>
