	<p>This is my portfolio.</p>
	<p>My name is Natalia Stroupe.</p>
	<p>I am going into my third year of schooling at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
           I am studying Computer Science with a specialization in cyber-security.
           My school offers a special program where I can add an extra year onto my studies and can graduate
           with a bachelors and masters at the same time! Because I can graduate a year early,
           I will be able to graduate in 2022 with both degrees!</p>
	<p>I really like cats :D This is my cat Lucy!</p>
