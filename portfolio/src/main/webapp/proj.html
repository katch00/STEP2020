      <h1>My Projects<h1>
        <p>This page containes the projects I have worked on so far! As I continue through school more will be added!"</p>
	<h2>Fenrir</h2>
	<p>The first is Fenrir, from my college's robotics team, ITR. Fenrir is a G-force robot, which means it uses gravity to help it move! For this project I worked on making the wheels,
	   adjusted small pieces of the code, replaced internal hardware, and spent way too much time PID tuning :P Fenrir got second place in the demolition round, which results in two broken wheels and a lot of broken machinery (oops).
	   Fenrir came second to ITR's Goliath, so the loss wasn't too harsh. However, during the main competition the inclines were too steep for our heavy robot to navigate, so we ended up with no points during that round :(.</p>
	<h2>CTFs</h2>
	<p>Another thing I enjoy working on is CTFs. My favorite CTF to participate in is the NCL competition. NCL is a great way to learn beginner to intermidiate security skills, and was a great introduction to security for me.
	   My favorite part of NCL is the training gym that they have every season; it is a great tool to both practice before the competition and go over rough topics you didn't understand after. 
	   NCL also offers reports at the end of each season comparing you to those in your tier to show you your strengths and weaknesses!</p>
	<h2>STEP 2020</h2>
	<p>This website is also a project! It was made during my summer STEP internship. This website is helping me learn HTML and CSS, as well as getting me used to using the shell and git. It is still a WIP, so be ready for more to come!</p>
